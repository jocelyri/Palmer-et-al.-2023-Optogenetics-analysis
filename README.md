##  Overview

### Workflow containing MATLAB, Python, and R code for:
  * Analysis of DS Task performance
  * Analysis of Optogenetic manipulations including
    * DS Task with cue-paired optogenetic manipulation sessions
    * Lever choice task with reward-paired optogenetic manipulation sessions
    * Intracranial Self Stimulation (ICSS) sessions

### Note about use/adapting:

Specifically designed for use with Christelle Opto Dataset
